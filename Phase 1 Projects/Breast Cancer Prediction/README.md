### Phase 01 Golden Task:

# Breast Cancer Prediction:

The objective of this project is to create a predictive model that can accurately classify breast cancer cases as benign or malignant based on a set of relevant features. By leveraging historical data and applying machine learning techniques, we aim to develop a reliable tool for assisting medical professionals in diagnosing breast cancer.

## Task 01 Conclusions:

- Created Two Predictive models using K-nearest neighbors and Artificial Neural Network for Breast Cancer Classification: **Benign(non-cancerous)/Malignment(cancerous)**
- Performed Proper Data cleaning and preprocessing to gain higher accuracy.
- K-nearest neighbors accuracy (KNN): **96.5%**
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN): **98.6%**
- ANN has better accuracy than KNN, hence saved the `best_model` (i.e. ANN), that can be helpful for medical professionals after appropriate deployment.
